1. LightTexturedSphereRender - render textured sphere with directional light.
1. TexturedCubeRender - render cube with texture.
1. TexturedQuadRender - render quad with texture, demonstrate how to apply 2D texture to the surface.
1. ColoredCubeRender - render multicolored cube, demonstrate how to use VAO with single VBO and IBO.
1. ColoredQuadRender - render multicolored quad, demonstrate how to use VAO with single VBO that contains multiple vertex attributes (positions and colors).
